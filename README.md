## Rules and Constraints üìÉ
- Each user must have a unique login.
- Accounts can only be opened for existing users.
- Account balance cannot be negative.
- Users with a single account cannot close it.

## Architecture üè°
The application follows a structured and scalable architecture, developed using:
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **S.O.L.I.D. Principles**
- **Design Patterns**

Database performance was optimized, and caching mechanisms were implemented to enhance application efficiency.

## Technologies ‚öôÔ∏è
The project leverages modern tools and technologies:
- **Java**: Core programming language.
- **Spring Framework**: A robust ecosystem including:
  - Spring Boot
  - Spring Data JPA
  - Spring Web
  - Spring AOP
- **Docker**: Application containerization.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database.
- **Redis**: In-memory data structure store for caching.
- **Maven**: Dependency management and build automation.
- **Swagger**: API documentation.
- **JUnit 5 & Mockito**: Testing frameworks.
